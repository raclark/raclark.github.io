description: In Which I Make a Test Post for my New Writing Site
---
"Huzzah!" I cried, as my website went live. Writing folders! Resumes! An about me section! Oh goodness, this was all quite exciting. I've got things looking progressively more professional, and I'm committing to developing Keeyom and gosh darnit I'm talking about doing NaNoWriMo!

I'm getting new programs, and new Twitters and widgets and Linkedins all set up, and with reasonably professional looking pictures. Things are setting up so that I might end up getting business cards, assuming that I can get that research assistant position that I'm angling for. And from there it's only a short leap to getting a job in the field come spring! Yes, things were moving along quite nicely, there was no doubting that.

Will it prove to be too much too fast? Would I be able to keep pace with my goals? Well I'd certainly be trying. It would be a matter of balancing the school with the work with the school's work and the language learning, not to mention the group meetings and the clubs and the writing groups and this was all seeming quite intense and like quite the run on sentence! But no. No. Take a step back, Robert. Things are going to be fine.

"You're an organized guy, Rob. You've just got to manage your time effectively." I said to myself.

Of course, this is when Matthew decided to tell me that as much as my first writing post was important, he did need to work in the morning. So as such, the point couldn't be explored too much further. So the post would be posted, and beds would be slept in. And come tomorrow, things would be written about further.
