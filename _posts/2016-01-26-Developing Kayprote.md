## Basic Plot Outline and other reference material.
### Basic thought process is this.

Central to the story is a conflict between the Keeyom culture (which by the time of ABB is an early state), and European settlers.
	* Individual polities each are generally ruled by a "council of elders"
	* These polities then select one member from this council to represent them at the state level.
		* Thusly, the Keeyom state is something of a heterarchy of associated 'chiefdoms' which share a cultural an political tradition.
		* It's broken down into the major cities, which support the smaller settlements, and represent their interests.
			* Conflict points include rising settlements wanting seats in the local councils, or rising to be their own chiefdoms.
				* Can be a source of civil war. Small scale conflicts of this nature are likely common.
				* Political unity is therefore not to be assumed.
				* There is a clan structure, and only one person of a clan may sit on the council. The council affirms new members.
					* Can cause disunity as the council may become insular. Happens moreso in some places than others.
				* At time of ABB, European settlers are pushing into the periphery of Keeyom lands.

European settlers push into Keeyom lands.
	* Settlers have been pushing into the continent for a couple hundred years.
	* A much lower level of religious cohesion has largely left Europe a much more balkanized place. Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark dominant.
		* Italy remains largely Roman Catholic. Fairly Cohesive. Controlled by the Papacy.
			* There are antipopes! Three of them. Aquitaine Catholics, Irish Catholics and Spanish Catholics.
				* Aquitaine is actually controlled by the church. Others are merely Catholic countries. French speakers.
					* Other French countries include Brittany, Orleans, Rouen, Bourges and Carcassonne
		* The Netherlands are a technological powerhouse, very cosmopolitan and a naval power. Strong animosity towards Denmark.
		* Denmark a naval power. Religiously cohesive. Strong animosity towards Netherlands.
		* Great Britain is not a thing. England controls much of what is does now, as well as parts of Wales.
			* Remainder of Wales is its own kingdom. Supports Ireland, which supports it right back. Is Irish Catholic.
			* Scotland is doing its own thing. Boy is it ever.
	* Middle East sees more power.
		* Byzantium! Orthodox church has much influence in that region. It's fairly religiously homogenous.
		* Arab/Jewish stuff to be added.










An explanation of why things are they way they are and not some other way (Includes info on where I'm handwaving).

	* First and foremost. Different archaeological record. Neanderthals got across the land bridge during the ice age 35000 years ago.
		* This is the ice age previous to the one humans came over in.
		* Neanderthals spread better in this timeline. Were largely wiped out in Europe, though more interbreeding occurred.
			* More occurred when humans came over in the following ice age. Lots of wiping out. Some interbreeding.
				* Inuit and subarctic region cultures tend to look a bit more human as a result.
		* Homo Floresiensis throughout Oceania, alongside humans who similarly intrebred to a certain extent. Some areas more pure than others.
		* Humans can breed true with either. Neanderthals and Florians can also, though far less easily. More distantly related.
	* I can justify the historical record largely being the same by assuming that 'magic' isn't figured out until certain points.
		* Also by not having it developed formally until later on.
		* Formal development happened at different times with different cultures.
			* Steal from much of modern myth as being precocious users of magic.
			* Greco-Roman's didn't get it until after the rise of Rome.
			* Egyptians got it a bit earlier, but developed slowly. Was much slower into iron age.
			* Rest of Europe gets it when spreads from Rome with the conquering.
			* Africa, pockets of oral traditions develop in different places. Resists the slave trade to better extent.
			* Oceania, develops early. Resists later contact.
			* Indus Valley develops it during its late bronze age. Resists Alexander's pushing their shit in.
			* Chinese develop it early in their bronze age.
			* Americas develop it in different places.
				* Mesoamerica by its late bronze age.
				* Andes region by its early iron age.
				* Keeyom before its bronze age.
				* Eastern Inuit before bronze age.
				* Northeast don't get it in time. Development largely happens all west of the Mississippi.
					* It spreads from these places outwards.

	* I am handwaving to different points with the different major civilizations.
		* Indus Valley Civilization survives in a form. Goes on to build itself up through future iterations.
			* Divergence is there. Region develops differently going forward.
			* Buffers from the West.
		* Chinese flourish as normal. Handwave point is up to its interactions with the Indus Valley Civilization. Minor variations from there on.
			* Things develop largely the same up until 1000 AD with more animosity towards Indus region.
				* Indus/Chinese relations are something to explore later. There's work to be done here.
		* Mesopotamia
			* Things go largely the same around here. Develops to bronze age with no major differences.
				* Minor differences come in with precocious magic users and trade with Indus Civilization.
			* Egyptian civilization develops magic in bronze age. Controls its territory better and expands outwards into Africa.
				* Slave trade occurs, selling many up into Mesopotamia.
				* Use is restricted to the nobility and clergy. Power rests there.
					* Power first solidifies with a man who uses mindfucky magic to make people revere him. He is the God* King.
					* Teaches it to children, direct subordinates and clergy. Limited number of users.
					* They don't go mindfucking everyone. It's more of a cultural thing that everyone reveres the God King.
					* Still remains largely Egyptian religion as is though.
			* Rest of Mesopotamia
				* Goes mostly the same. Alexander-analogue has his shit pushed back by the Indus Valley, then dies.
			* Rome
				* Develops magic after Rome's rise. Shift to empire from republic has to do with rise of magic.
				* This occurs around 50-20 BC.
		* Americas develop in similar ways in some respects. Very different ways in others.
			* Mesoamerica will develop a culture that is rather similar to how it did on Earth.	
				* In the rough strokes at least.
				* Spreads into SW United States, this culture.
			* Ditto for Andes
				* Largely the same. Expands much more.
			* Pacific Northwest cultures are much more developed than Earth-equivalent cultures.
				* Proto-Keeyom cultural values. Spirits and Animism. Mountain as symbol of protector, guide, etc.
				* Keeyom will become dominant culture in region from 1100 AD onwards.
	
	* Okay, so what happens then?
		* In Europe, Christianity happens.
			* Jesus shows up. Precocious magic user for his region.
				* Jesus still is the same. Jesus existed. He was a good guy. We're not going to be shitting on Christianity here.
				* Jesus sees fundamental injustices. Makes his disciples trust him implicitly. Uses his abilities to push his agenda.
				* He sees a lot more initial success. Romans put him down. Things go back to normal. Ish.
			* Christianity pushes out much harder in this case.
				* Christianity has the strength to get into Rome. Pushes out further.
				* This marks the fall of magic use in Rome. Drives it underground.
			* Rome eventually falls, as per normal. Byzantium is centre of civilization, as per normal.
			* Magic rediscovered by Jewish population in the Levant ca. 900 AD.
			* Magic spreads from Mohammed, from Islam's inception.
			* The crusades will just go terribly. Terribly. Far worse than in reality.

			* Christianity starts fracturing. East-West Split deepens. Catholic heresies. Bad things for the catholic church.
				* Three major sects of catholicism will develop. Roman, Aquitaine, and Irish.
				* Orthodox church remains strong in the east.
		* Things are fairly similar though in Europe up until 1300-1500 or so depending on region.
